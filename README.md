## <span style="color:#ff6600">Project Overview</span>
In collaboration with Professor Divya Nayar, this project aimed to develop a robust model for predicting the thermal conductivity of polymer-based composites. The focus was on understanding how varying mass fractions of fillers, particularly polyethylene and polystyrene, influence the thermal conductivity of the composite material.

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong><span class="icon">üìÖ</span>Situation:</strong></span> The accuracy of existing theoretical models for predicting the thermal conductivity of polymer-based composites was found to be insufficient. The project commenced in February 2023 as part of a course project under the guidance of Prof. Divya Nayar.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong><span class="icon">üéØ</span>Task:</strong></span> Our task was to establish a predictive model capable of predicting more accurately than theoritical models, determining the thermal conductivity of polymer-based composites across different mass fractions of fillers.</li>
