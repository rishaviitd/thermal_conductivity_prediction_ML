<h1>Thermal Conductivity Prediction</h1>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In collaboration with Professor Divya Nayar, this project aimed to develop a robust model for predicting the thermal conductivity of polymer-based composites. The focus was on understanding how varying mass fractions of fillers, particularly polyethylene and polystyrene, influence the thermal conductivity of the composite material.</p>
